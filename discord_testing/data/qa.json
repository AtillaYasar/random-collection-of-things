    "answer": "Module is for theme, writing style and pace, they are quite bad at retaining knowledge.\nThis is where Lorebook enters the picture. Lorebook is basically a way to select information to be added to the context depending on what is already there, like putting a character attributes.\nThey are very different and can be used in synergy."

If you use that it will open in fullscreen and work as an app in most respected.\n\nApple has a similar function, but not sure how to access that."
