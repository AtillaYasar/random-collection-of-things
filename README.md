# random-collection-of-things
name is self-explanatory... most of my repos will probably end up here

## Ram aid + text editor with highlighting
- my favorite tool by far, i use it for almost every single task that requires thinking and/or oversight over any problem or chunk of text
- https://github.com/AtillaYasar/mental-tools/
- AI extension: https://github.com/AtillaYasar/text-editor-OpenAI (should have been a fork or module or update or something..)

## Oracle
- command line interface  
- if you ask a question, returns 1 of 6 responses  
- video showing it https://youtu.be/B7JihYaXU6s

## pixiv
- beautiful command line interface
- download.py: download from pixiv
- collage.py: make image collages, options for custom captions, number of columns, font size and color, ability to set maximum image size
- how to use? just run (meaning, download and double click) either app. it will be self-explanatory
- note: download.py will break if pixiv patches this dumb hack that lets you download original images without a login. lol.

## run_something.py
- prints a list of files, lets you enter a number, runs that file

## make_something.py
- lets you write a filename, creates that file in the current directory
- if you it's a html, it will insert some things
- if the file already exists, it wont let you make it

## get_toc.py
- little command line interface to find and print the table of contents of a .md file in the current directory
- usage example here: https://youtu.be/OGKUPjmPEx8
